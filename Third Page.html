<h3>HISTORY</h3>
<p>The roots of the College of Industrial Education (CIE) can be traced in 1929 when the first formal two-year Industrial Teacher Education was offered at the then Philippine School of Arts and Trades. At present, the college serves as the foundation of teacher education in the University. The BS in Industrial Education program at CIE has been offered since 1951 as a four-year teacher education for elementary and secondary levels. Currently, CIE is composed of four departments, namely: Professional Industrial Education, Student Teaching, Technical Arts, and Home Economics.</p>
